## Install
You can run the setup script if you're on linux using the commands
`chmod -x setup.sh`
`bash setup.sh`

Follow the prompt and the script will walk you through setting up your environment. Make sure that the config values are filled. If you'd rather fill them out manually you can find the configs in neurons/config.py. 

## Registering
Once installed you can register the miner or validator by using the register script. Registering lets the block chain and the validator know that you are are going to be available to provide the service on the chain.
`chmod -x register.sh`
`bash register.sh`

## Serving
Finally you can serve the miner or validator with the launch script. 
`bash launch.sh`

## Manual Install

If you would like to manually install the library you can follow these steps.

### Setup your environment
You can skip these steps if you already have the required installed.
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
`sudo apt install make build-essential git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev protobuf-compiler tmux libsndfile1-dev python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip python-is-python3`
`python -m venv .venv`
`source .venv/bin/activate`

`cp .env.example .env`

Fill out the .env file with the correct configuration information

### Setup pip
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
`pip install setuptools wheel`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Install module
`rm -r modules/translation/seamless`
`python -m modules.install_module translation`

### Register Miner/Validator
`btcli subnet register --netuid "$BT_NETUID" --subtensor.network "$BT_NETUID" --wallet.name "$BT_VALIDATOR_COLDKEY" --wallet.hotkey "$BT_VALIDATOR_HOTKEY"`


The Bittensor Subnet 1 for Text Prompting is built using this template. See [prompting](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting) for how to configure the files and how to add monitoring and telemetry and support multiple miner types. Also see this Subnet 1 in action on [Taostats](https://taostats.io/subnets/netuid-1/) explorer.

## Installation

### Before you proceed
Before you proceed with the installation of the subnet, note the following: 

- Use these instructions to run your subnet locally for your development and testing, or on Bittensor testnet or on Bittensor mainnet. 
- **IMPORTANT**: We **strongly recommend** that you first run your subnet locally and complete your development and testing before running the subnet on Bittensor testnet. Furthermore, make sure that you next run your subnet on Bittensor testnet before running it on the Bittensor mainnet.
- You can run your subnet either as a subnet owner, or as a subnet validator or as a subnet miner. 
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you are aware of the minimum compute requirements for your subnet. See the [Minimum compute YAML configuration](./min_compute.yml).
- Note that installation instructions differ based on your situation: For example, installing for local development and testing will require a few additional steps compared to installing for testnet. Similarly, installation instructions differ for a subnet owner vs a validator or a miner. 

### Install

- **Running locally**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running Subnet Locally](./docs/running_on_staging.md).
- **Running on Bittensor testnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Test Network](./docs/running_on_testnet.md).
- **Running on Bittensor mainnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Main Network](./docs/running_on_mainnet.md).

## Writing your own incentive mechanism

As described in [Quickstarter template](#quickstarter-template) section above, when you are ready to write your own incentive mechanism, update this template repository by editing the following files. The code in these files contains detailed documentation on how to update the template. Read the documentation in each of the files to understand how to update the template. There are multiple **TODO**s in each of the files identifying sections you should update. These files are:
- `template/protocol.py`: Contains the definition of the wire-protocol used by miners and validators.
- `neurons/miner.py`: Script that defines the miner's behavior, i.e., how the miner responds to requests from validators.
- `neurons/validator.py`: This script defines the validator's behavior, i.e., how the validator requests information from the miners and determines the scores.
- `template/forward.py`: Contains the definition of the validator's forward pass.
- `template/reward.py`: Contains the definition of how validators reward miner responses.

In addition to the above files, you should also update the following files:
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for your project. Update this file to reflect your project's documentation.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: This file contains the instructions for contributing to your project. Update this file to reflect your project's contribution guidelines.
- `template/__init__.py`: This file contains the version of your project.
- `setup.py`: This file contains the metadata about your project. Update this file to reflect your project's metadata.
- `docs/`: This directory contains the documentation for your project. Update this directory to reflect your project's documentation.

__Note__
The `template` directory should also be renamed to your project name.

# Writing your own subnet API
To leverage the abstract `SubnetsAPI` in Bittensor, you can implement a standardized interface. This interface is used to interact with the Bittensor network and can be used by a client to interact with the subnet through its exposed axons.

What does Bittensor communication entail? Typically two processes, (1) preparing data for transit (creating and filling `synapse`s) and (2), processing the responses received from the `axon`(s).

This protocol uses a handler registry system to associate bespoke interfaces for subnets by implementing two simple abstract functions:
- `prepare_synapse`
- `process_responses`

These can be implemented as extensions of the generic `SubnetsAPI` interface.  E.g.:


This is abstract, generic, and takes(`*args`, `**kwargs`) for flexibility. See the extremely simple base class:
```python
class SubnetsAPI(ABC):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        self.wallet = wallet
        self.dendrite = bt.dendrite(wallet=wallet)

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return await self.query_api(*args, **kwargs)

    @abstractmethod
    def prepare_synapse(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Prepare the synapse-specific payload.
        """
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def process_responses(self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]) -> Any:
        """
        Process the responses from the network.
        """
        ...

```


Here is a toy example:

```python
from bittensor.subnets import SubnetsAPI
from MySubnet import MySynapse

class MySynapseAPI(SubnetsAPI):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        super().__init__(wallet)
        self.netuid = 99

    def prepare_synapse(self, prompt: str) -> MySynapse:
        # Do any preparatory work to fill the synapse
        data = do_prompt_injection(prompt)

        # Fill the synapse for transit
        synapse = StoreUser(
            messages=[data],
        )
        # Send it along
        return synapse

    def process_responses(self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]) -> str:
        # Look through the responses for information required by your application
        for response in responses:
            if response.dendrite.status_code != 200:
                continue
            # potentially apply post processing
            result_data = postprocess_data_from_response(response)
        # return data to the client
        return result_data
```

You can use a subnet API to the registry by doing the following:
1. Download and install the specific repo you want
1. Import the appropriate API handler from bespoke subnets
1. Make the query given the subnet specific API
